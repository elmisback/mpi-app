# mpi-app

This is a clone of a scammer's rendition of a research application. Please do not use it for treatment.

I stumbled across [this absurdly-priced stuttering-treatment app](https://casafuturatech.com/mpistutter/) which appears to be based on [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610276/) studying the effect of modifying phonation intervals (MPI) through biofeedback as a possible treatment for adults who stutter. (Footnote 7 of the paper actually refers to the app as a "crude imitation" of the true program.)

It was interesting learning what phonation is (sustained sound at a relatively musical frequency) and how to distinguish it from the noise of wind/"hissing" (frequency filtering with a Fourier transform). "Zzzzz" sounds were the most tricky to detect, because they have a lot of extra noise.
